The idea behind this is quite simple, I wanted to make a third-party questing system similar to Valve's contracker.

I'd call this far from something useable but more of a *way to do it*. It's basically a Proof of Concept.

To showcase the capabilities you have through hl2.exe hijacking [Which sounds way worse than it actually is], this small program written in Golang parses the console log for weapon contracts. [e.g. contracts which ask you to use a certain weapon].

Again, this is more of a "here look at this weird thing Valve allows you to take advantage of" but if somebody actually wants to produce a community questing system outside of this small 72HR jam, feel free to DM me or write a mail at tf2@tomGER.eu.
